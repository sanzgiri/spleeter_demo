This app is for demo purposes only. The goal is to test algorithms that separate the vocal track from background music to improve accuracy for speech recognition tasks.
 It uses the [Spleeter] (https://github.com/deezer/spleeter) library recently open-sourced by [Deezer Research] (https://deezer.io/releasing-spleeter-deezer-r-d-source-separation-engine-2b88985e797e).
